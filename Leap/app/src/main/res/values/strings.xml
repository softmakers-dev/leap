        1) In Android MainActivity, I want a WebView component left without any component.
        In Kotlin please.

        2) I want the WebView set with custom WebViewClient with constructor having a context as its parameter

        3) Back button function is needed.

        4) A warning showed up that read onBackPressed at 'super.onBackPressed()' was deprecated. How should the code be modified?

        5) An error occurred that read "Can not extract resource from com.android.aaptcompiler.ParsedResource". Whats wrong?

        6) When a button click event occurred, if the link url contains 'pdf', whether any pdf reader applications are already installed should be checked. What will be the solution?

        7) Sorry, it's not the case of button click. It's a link.

        8) In case that any pdf reader application are not installed, play store should show up with the search results of keyword 'pdf reader'.

        9) When a link with url to pdf file is clicked, the pdf file should be downloaded first.
        Important thing is the location of the downloaded file. It should be specified by the FileProvider.
        And the download should be done at a directory specified by FileProvider. The download directory should be public that other application can access.
        Finally a content uri should be retrieved from the downloaded file.
        Can you do that in Kotlin?
